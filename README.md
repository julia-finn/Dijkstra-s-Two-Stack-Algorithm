# Dijkstra-s-Two-Stack-Algorithm
Implement a variation of Dijkstra's 2-stack algorithm for evaluating arithmetic expressions involving integers combined with +, -, *, / and ^ operators as well as parentheses. The code required for this problem set is required to read a sequence of strings (or tokens) from the input that form an arithmetic expression.
Your program is required to evaluate the expression and print the result.
